A few days ago, I saw the [Guess my word][GuessMyWord] game on the front page of Hacker News. Before spoiling the fun for myself by checking out the comments, I decided to try my hand at writing a solution in Elixir. Afterwards, I generalized the code to choose its own word from the UNIX dictionary and then "guess" it, applying a binary search based on the feedback of whether each guess was alphabetically greater or less than the word itself.

{% gist ab458ec544178fb86076 %}

Example output:

{% highlight sh %}

$ iex words.exs 

Word is: barruly
Less than: modificatory
Less than: eagerness
Less than: canari
Greater than: asthenosphere
Less than: bifoliolate
Greater than: barad
Less than: beguilement
Less than: batzen
Less than: basaltic
Greater than: barmbrack
Greater than: barreler
Less than: bartholomew
Greater than: barrio
Found word: barruly

{% endhighlight %}

Something I encountered worth mentioning is how Elixir compares strings that have different capitalization. Capital letters are "less than" their lower case versions:

{% highlight elixir %}

    iex> "B" < "b"
    true

{% endhighlight %}

Knowing this, we use `String.downcase` in our implementation to avoid comparison issues in the binary search. Binary search has a time complexity of:

<div class="equation" id="eq"></div>

Given that the UNIX dictionary has 235,886 words

{% highlight sh %}
$ cat /usr/share/dict/words | wc -l
235886
{% endhighlight %}

the fact the our algorithm took 14 steps to "guess" the word is plausible given

<div class="equation" id="eq2"></div>

which is the number of steps we would expect it to take to guess our word.

<script type="text/javascript">
    katex.render("O(log_{2}n)", document.getElementById("eq"));
    katex.render("O(log_{2}235886) \\approx O(17.85)", document.getElementById("eq2"));
</script>
